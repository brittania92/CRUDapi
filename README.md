# CRUD API

The goal of this project was to build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API. 
I began with creating a DynamoDB table using the DynamoDB console, then I created a Lambda function to link the DynamboDB table to the HTTP API.
After linking my function to the HTTP API I launched AWS Cloud9 IDE to test my API.
